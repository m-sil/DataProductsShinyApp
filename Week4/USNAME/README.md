Developping Data Products - Shiny App - Favourite Names Popularity

This repo contains the supporting documentation for a Shiny App developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization. 

The application is based on the "US baby Names" data set that can be downloaded from here:https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names; the data set gives the number of babies that are given a specific name each year in the US.

The Shiny app allows you to see the historical trend of given baby names for four different names, in the US.
Once you chose a name the app returns a graph showing the historical trend.
